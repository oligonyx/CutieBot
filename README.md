# CutieBot

*Yet another Discord bot...*


## Photo library

Various commands allow you to be shown a random picture from a Google Photos library, add new pics using Discord modals, update their titles and descriptions, delete them...

And all this thanks to ✨ web scraping ✨. I had never tried before ~~and had a hard time discovering how it works~~ but I'm pretty satisfied of the result!

(also Google's bad but using their albums was the easiest way to implement my thing)


## Other features

- Daily reminders through private messages
- Check the raw content of an embed (useful when Discord is messing up with image size)
- Auto-replies depending on content (didn't set everything in this public repo for privacy concerns)
